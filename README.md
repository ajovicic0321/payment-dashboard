## API Configuration

The application connects to the GraphQL API at:
- **Endpoint**: `https://mo-graphql.microapps-staging.com`
- **Authentication**: API Key `pk_test_4a140607778e1217f56ccb8b50540f91`

### Available Queries

1. **`chargesDateRangeKPI`**: Fetches aggregated payment metrics for analytics
2. **`charges`**: Retrieves paginated list of payment records
3. **`charge`**: Gets detailed information for a specific payment

## Usage

### Dashboard Navigation
- **Home**: Analytics dashboard with KPIs and charts
- **Payments**: Complete list of all payments with filtering
- **Payment Details**: Individual payment information

### Filtering Payments
- **Status Filter**: Filter by payment status (succeeded, pending, failed, canceled)
- **Date Range**: Select custom date ranges for payment data
- **Clear Filters**: Reset all filters to default state

### Data Visualization
- **Line Chart**: Daily payment volume trends
- **Bar Chart**: Payment status distribution
- **KPI Cards**: Key metrics with formatted currency values

## Design Decisions

### Architecture
- **Component-based Architecture**: Modular, reusable components for maintainability
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between data fetching, UI, and business logic
- **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all API responses

### User Experience
- **Loading States**: Skeleton loaders and spinners for better perceived performance
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages with retry capabilities
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels and keyboard navigation support

### Performance
- **Apollo Client Caching**: Efficient data caching to reduce API calls
- **Pagination**: Server-side pagination for large datasets
- **Lazy Loading**: Components loaded on demand for better initial load times

## Assumptions Made

1. **Currency Formatting**: All amounts are assumed to be in cents and converted to euros for display
2. **Date Handling**: Unix timestamps are converted to human-readable formats
3. **API Schema**: GraphQL schema structure inferred from requirements
4. **Error States**: Graceful degradation when API data is unavailable
5. **Authentication**: API key authentication as specified in requirements

## Development

### Available Scripts

- `npm start`: Start development server
- `npm build`: Build production bundle
- `npm test`: Run test suite
- `npm run eject`: Eject from Create React App (irreversible)

### Code Style
- ESLint configuration for consistent code formatting
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Material-UI design system for consistent styling

## Deployment

1. **Build the application**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy the `build` folder** to your preferred hosting service (Netlify, Vercel, AWS S3, etc.)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Connection Errors**
   - Verify the API endpoint is accessible
   - Check API key authentication
   - Ensure network connectivity

2. **Build Errors**
   - Clear node_modules and reinstall dependencies
   - Check TypeScript configuration
   - Verify all imports are correct

3. **Runtime Errors**
   - Check browser console for detailed error messages
   - Verify GraphQL query syntax
   - Ensure all required environment variables are set

## Future Enhancements

- **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket integration for live data updates
- **Export Functionality**: CSV/PDF export for payment data
- **Advanced Analytics**: More sophisticated charts and metrics
- **User Authentication**: Secure user login and role-based access
- **Mobile App**: React Native version for mobile devices
